• help collect & structure information for the human MM
• assist with small support tasks in tickets
• but are never allowed to run trades alone or hold money/items themselves.

• 16+ and at least 1 month active in the **Nexus** / STB community
• no known scam cases, no major drama / toxic behaviour in trading servers

• stable internet + can use Discord confidently (threads, screenshots, etc.)
• able to record short clips (gameplay or delivery proof) and upload them to Discord
• at least 2 usable Fortnite accounts for trade-related tasks
• can understand and write English clearly

**Role Limits**
As an MM Trainee you:
• never hold money or items yourself
• never run trades alone – always under supervision of a Rookie / Verified / Senior MM or **FocusedOVP**
• do not run your own MM service outside **Nexus**
• are never MM in your own trades – only a trader there
• only work inside official **Nexus** tickets.

The role can be changed or removed at any time if there are doubts about your trust, behaviour, or fit.
