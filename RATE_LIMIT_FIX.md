# Nexus-BOT2 Optimization & Persistence Report

## 1. Rate Limit & Performance Fixes
- **Smart Member Fetching**: Replaced heavy startup fetching with on-demand chunked fetching (200 members at a time).
- **Accurate Pagination**: Fixed dashboard logic to show correct member ranges (e.g., "Showing 481-510 of 510") and reliable page navigation.
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Bot uses local cache for role verification to minimize Discord API calls.

## 2. Persistent Storage (TiDB Cloud)
The bot has been migrated from local JSON files to **TiDB Cloud** (MySQL-compatible) to ensure no data is lost during Koyeb redeploys.

### Changes Implemented:
- **Database Utility**: Created `utils/db.js` for secure TLS connection to TiDB.
- **Refactored Storage**: `commands/utility/storage.js` now reads/writes guild settings to the cloud.
- **Invite Persistence**: `inviteManager.js` now stores all invite data and join history in TiDB.
- **Transcript Storage**: `utils/dashboardTranscript.js` and dashboard routes now use TiDB for ticket transcripts.
- **Trusted IPs**: Dashboard auto-login now uses a persistent `trusted_ips` table.

### Required Environment Variables for Koyeb:
To maintain this persistence, ensure these variables are set in your Koyeb dashboard:
- `TIDB_HOST`: `gateway01.eu-central-1.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com`
- `TIDB_PORT`: `4000`
- `TIDB_USER`: `39dLWhtiYpb23H3.root`
- `TIDB_PASSWORD`: `Fy7EgTV2syrN0E3N`
- `TIDB_DB`: `test`

## 3. Multi-Server Support
- **Dynamic Guild List**: The dashboard dropdown now correctly shows all servers where the bot is added and the user has staff permissions.
- **Session Sync**: Switching servers correctly updates the dashboard view and fetches server-specific data.
