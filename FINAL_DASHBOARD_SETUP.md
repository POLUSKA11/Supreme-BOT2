# Final Dashboard Setup Instructions

Your Nexus-BOT2 Web Dashboard is now fully integrated and ready for deployment! Here's what has been completed and what you need to do next.

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **React Dashboard Application**: Created a modern, responsive dashboard with Tailwind CSS styling
2. **Discord OAuth2 Authentication**: Implemented secure Discord login with staff role verification
3. **API Endpoints**: Connected all dashboard features to your bot's live data:
   - **Stats**: Real-time server statistics (members, tickets, trades, uptime)
   - **Tickets**: View and manage active tickets
   - **Users**: Search and view user profiles with invite statistics
   - **Giveaways**: View active giveaways
   - **Settings**: Manage bot configuration
   - **Audit Logs**: View Discord audit logs
4. **Express Integration**: Updated your `index.js` to serve the dashboard
5. **Session Management**: Implemented secure session handling with express-session
6. **Staff Authorization**: Only users with these roles can access the dashboard:
   - `982731220913913856`
   - `958703198447755294`
   - `1410661468688482314`

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Your Environment Variables on Koyeb

Add these environment variables to your Koyeb service settings:

```
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=1459183931005075701
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=2HFpZf8paKaxZnSfuhbAFr4nx8hn-ymg
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Important**: For `SESSION_SECRET`, generate a secure random string. You can use:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### Step 2: Update Your package.json

Your root `package.json` needs these scripts. Add or update them:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "build": "cd dashboard && npm run build",
    "postinstall": "npm rebuild better-sqlite3 && cd dashboard && npm install"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Nexus-BOT2
git add .
git commit -m "Add web dashboard with Discord OAuth2 and live data integration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Koyeb Will Auto-Deploy

Once you push to GitHub, Koyeb will automatically:
1. Pull the latest code
2. Run `npm install` (which triggers `postinstall` to build the dashboard)
3. Run `npm start` to start your bot with the dashboard

### Step 5: Access Your Dashboard

Once deployed, visit:
```
https://breakable-tiger-nexusbot1-d8a3b39c.koyeb.app/dashboard
```

You'll be redirected to Discord login. Only staff members will be able to access the dashboard.

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Discord Credentials**: Your Client ID and Secret are configured as environment variables on Koyeb. They are NOT hardcoded in the repository.
2. **Staff Roles**: Only users with the specified role IDs can access the dashboard.
3. **Session Security**: Sessions are stored server-side and expire after 24 hours.
4. **HTTPS**: Koyeb provides automatic HTTPS for your application.

## 🧪 Testing Locally (Optional)

If you want to test the dashboard locally before deploying:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the bot
cd /home/ubuntu/Nexus-BOT2
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start the dashboard dev server
cd /home/ubuntu/Nexus-BOT2/dashboard
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173` for the dashboard (with hot reload) and `http://localhost:8000` for the bot API.

**Login not working:**
- Ensure your Discord application is set up correctly in the Developer Portal
- Verify the redirect URI matches: `https://your-koyeb-url/api/dashboard/auth/callback`
- Check that your Discord Client ID and Secret are correct

**API endpoints returning 404:**
- Ensure `routes/dashboardApi.js` is in the correct location
- Verify `index.js` has the dashboard API routes configured

**Staff can't access dashboard:**
- Verify the user has one of the staff role IDs
- Check that the bot has permission to fetch member roles
